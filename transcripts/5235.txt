Hello and welcome to today's class. My name is Teri Meme, Mr. Abbasag Glowin. So first I want to welcome you here and before we dive into what we need to do talking about Vitas sign as the first introductory part of the topic, I want us to have an establishment of certain things before diving into Vitas sign as a topic. Now before we go into Vitas sign, the first thing I want us to establish is what we call nothing. What is nothing? Why are we here as nurses and why are we here in this group? Now what you must understand here is the fact that we as nurses, we are key players in the society and in the health sector. It therefore means that your ability to know who you are will help you to stand out and be able to play your role. Hence, what we say, being here, please take everything seriously and personally. The truth is this, here is a platform where God changes destiny. I am opening. Success is real. However, you need to play your part. How is your part coming in? You need to be dedicated. You need to be intentional in being in this group. And I can assure you by the help of God, whatever the reason that made you to come here, you will not go empty-handed. So shall it be in Jesus' name, Eme. So diving into what we need to talk about, what is nothing? Now according to America's Nurses Association, in 1995, they defined nothing as the diagnosis and treatment of human response response to health and illness. According to the American NOSES association, they define NOSES as the diagnosis and treatment of human response to health and illness. That is how they define NOSES. So it therefore means that as a NOS, going into the profession, your responsibility or rather your duty is to first diagnose treat human responses to health and illness. So what is health? Health according to what health organization is defined as a state of complete physical, social, psychological well-being of an individual and not merely the absence of disease or or deformity. Of course, we all know that definition. That is health. So it therefore means that. Nothing, you are saying, no, your duty is to diagnose, treat and or human respond to health according to World Health Organization and INES. What is INES? Deviation from health. That is INES. What have I said? Nothing according to America's Association is defined as a diagnosis treatment of human response to health and innings. The big question then is what is their the role or rather the qualities of the nurse? What are the qualities of the nurse? Knowing fully whether the nurse is responsible for treatment of visual response to health and innings and all of that, what they become your quality of a nurse or quality of a good nurse? 1. Compassion. Compassion simply means that you are not showing genuine concern, showing genuine concern and empathy for the patient's physical and emotional needs. No, because we live in a world where because of their task involved, because of the volume of work we are faced with, we tend to lack compassion. But of course, it's quite decent people who lack compassion in this country but the time they travel a certain area, they are so compassionate. So one of the qualities of a good nurse is one compassion, you showing a new concern for the patient, having empathy for the patient. Two communication skills. Now, nurses must communicate infectively with patient family and head care team. As a nurse, you must be able to communicate effectively. You will be able to talk in a simple term with the patient and the family we understand. Not just that, you should be able to communicate with your team members. Why your team members? Your colleagues? Those are the top and those below you. Communication with the head getting. Communication skill. Next is critical thinking. Now, as a nurse, you must be able to think critically. Good thinking ability helps you to be able to make sound decisions. The truth is this, you cannot think critically if you are not theoretically oriented. That's to say, you must be able to know the rationale behind the things that you do. That is where God helped us to create this platform where we equipped you with theories, with knowledge that is able to help you to make certain decisions where you go into the profession. So critical thinking, the nurse must be able to think critically. How we are able to make a strong decision based on the volume of knowledge you know. So critical thinking is another good quality. is attention to details. Now, the nurse should be able to accurately administer medication, record that as accurately, and monitor patient vitals and document appropriately. Attention to details. You don't administer 0.01 medication and write 0.1. One, details, attention to details, vital sign, be able to record things accordingly, monitor patient accurately, document accurately, attention to details. And of course the next attribute of a goodness is patient. Now, patient is a virtue. You must be able to be, you have patient. patient for people be be be be passionate and have patience don't always be in a hurry as in us so you should be able to have ability to listen to people ability to deal with people situation however you need to be patient to listen to them and of course the next quality is what called professionalism now professionalism simply means you no matter how how the activities you do you You should be able to maintain your ethical standard. What is ethical standard? You must be able to respect confidentiality. You must be able to demonstrate integrity. You must be able to maintain your profession as a nurse. Nurses are clean. Nurses are neat. Nurses are respectful. Nurses are the key information that I give to them. Professionalism. You don't go around gossiping. You don't go around dressing anyhow. don't go around talking anyhow, maintain professionalism. Next attribute is what called adaptability. You should be able to adapt. Adaptability, flexibility. You know, you should be able to adapt to any situation. That is the reason why sometimes when people ask me questions, what area of nursing is coming in nursing council? How do you want them to tell you an area that we come? When After graduation, you go into the world, nobody will tell you this is a nausea. So these are the patients that we come. Flexibility, adaptability. You should be able to adapt to changes, new procedure, new environment, new cases, adaptability. Nesis team work. Now, nobody is an island. So you are a nausea. You must be able to work with other nurses, other professionals, other head care provider so as to maintain safety of the patient. Team work. So the nurse must be able to work with the doctors, work with other nurses, work with other head care providers so as to promote the safety and recovery of the patient. And of course the next we will talk about is physical and emotional stamina. The nurse must be able to maintain or she be able to display physical, emotional, and maturity, stamina to be able to withstand situations, resilience. She be able to tolerate, be determined to achieve, have the spirit to win. You know that's the reason why I tell nurse that no matter what happens, no for sure you are called for this profession. as well as we go through this journey in this period of preparation. Know for sure that irrespective of what happens, irrespective of the pressure, irrespective from your pressure from school, from home, what in the show I must have my arrow in. Physical and emotional stamina. So, Gnosis must be able to have physical and emotional stamina, resilience for their profession. And of course, the last wish I will talk about is dedication to lifelong learning. Learning has no ending. It is there for me as a Gnosis, you must be able to stay updated. You must be able to stay updated with trends, stay updated with practice, Stop detail with information. What have I talked about? I've talked about what is nothing. Talked about the quality of the nose. I started by talking about that the nose is defined or rather nothing is defined according to America Health Association that nothing is defined as the diagnosis and treatment of human response to health and illness. And I went down to talk about the definition of health according to what health position the health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, psychological, spiritual web of individual and not merely the absence of disease or illness or deformity rather. Why illness of course at the other end is defined as deviation from normal. We'll talk about that as we move on. However, after knowing what definition of nothing is, and I went down to talk about the quality of a goodness. Quality of a goodness and I started by talking about compassion that you must be compassionate about a professional compassionate about the patient, compassionate about having a party for the patient both his physical and emotional needs and of course you should be able to communicate communicate skidfully so communication skills should be able to communicate effectively with the patient the family and the head get team and of course I want to talk about Critical thinking that the nurse you must be able to assess Good the critical thinking the nurse should be able to have ability to think and make sound decisions decision and not just making some decision that will come based on the volume of information that you know that is why you must be able to gather material to read people to Get information and of course I want to talk about attention to detail I'm talking about attention to detail talk about accuracy in demonstration in medication administration administration, vitalside documentation and every other thing procedure that you do you must be able to To give attention to details and I want to talk about patience that as a nurse you must be patient with their patient Be patient with your colleagues be patient with the head care team That is the only way you can achieve You can achieve the quality of a good nurse and I also talked about professionalism There are some laws you must be able to maintain ethical standards, what are ethical standards? Noses don't steal, Noses respect themselves, Noses keep information, confidentiality and all of that. And of course, you should be able to demonstrate integrity. And then we'll talk about adaptability which is also called flexibility. There are some laws you must be able to adapt to changes. to a new procedure, changes to environment, changes to whatever it is that comes your way in the profession. And of course I also talked about teamwork. Talking about teamwork, you cannot do the job alone. So it therefore means that you should be able to work with the team members, including the doctors, your colleagues and other juniors that you work with or other team members. Teamwork. And of course I want to talk about the physical emotional stamina that I say no see what you want to understand the fact that there are situations that we come demanding there are two demanding that demand the physical or demanding emotionally however you must be able to demonstrate stamina and that is why I said in the profession as you move through what your career develop stamina develop thick skin thick skin because challenges must come and of course dedication to lifelong learning You should be able to be open minded to a lane and because of doing all of these, success is sure. So these are some of the qualities of a good knows. So I'm going to pause it here to move on to talk about the next topic called patient be of right and then obligation of the patient. So I'm going to pause it here. Thank you.y
